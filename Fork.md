Forking a GitHub Repository
The first step is to fork the GitHub repository with which you’d like to work. For example, if you were interested in helping contribute content to the Open vSwitch web site, which is itself hosted as a GitHub repository, you would first fork it. Forking it is basically making a copy of the repository, but with a link back to the original.

Forking a repository is really straightforward:

Make sure you’re logged into GitHub with your account.

Find the GitHub repository with which you’d like to work.

Click the Fork button on the upper right-hand side of the repository’s page.

That’s it—you now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
