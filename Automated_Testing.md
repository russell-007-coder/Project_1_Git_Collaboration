*What is Automation Testing?*

Automation Testing or Test Automation is a software testing technique that performs using special automated testing software tools to execute a test case suite. 
On the contrary, Manual Testing is performed by a human sitting in front of a computer carefully executing the test steps.
The automation testing software can also enter test data into the System Under Test, compare expected and actual results and generate detailed test reports.
Test Automation demands considerable investments of money and resources.

*Why Test Automation?*

Test Automation is the best way to increase the effectiveness, test coverage, and execution speed in software testing. Automated software testing is important due to the 
following reasons:

Manual Testing of all workflows, all fields, all negative scenarios is time and money consuming
It is difficult to test for multilingual sites manually
Test Automation does not require Human intervention. You can run automated test unattended (overnight)
Test Automation increases the speed of test execution
Automation helps increase Test Coverage
Manual Testing can become boring and hence error-prone.

*Which Test Cases to Automate?*
Test cases to be automated can be selected using the following criterion to increase the automation ROI

High Risk - Business Critical test cases
Test cases that are repeatedly executed
Test Cases that are very tedious or difficult to perform manually
Test Cases which are time-consuming

*Automated Testing Process:*
Following steps are followed in an Automation Process

Step 1) Test Tool Selection

Step 2) Define scope of Automation

Step 3) Planning, Design and Development

Step 4) Test Execution

Step 5) Maintenance

*Test tool selection*
Test Tool selection largely depends on the technology the Application Under Test is built on. For instance, QTP does not support Informatica. 
So QTP cannot be used for testing Informatica applications. It's a good idea to conduct a Proof of Concept of Tool on AUT.

*Define the scope of Automation*
The scope of automation is the area of your Application Under Test which will be automated. Following points help determine scope:

The features that are important for the business
Scenarios which have a large amount of data
Common functionalities across applications
Technical feasibility
The extent to which business components are reused
The complexity of test cases
Ability to use the same test cases for cross-browser testing

*Planning, Design, and Development*
During this phase, you create an Automation strategy & plan, which contains the following details-

- Automation tools selected
- Framework design and its features
- In-Scope and Out-of-scope items of automation
- Automation testbed preparation
- Schedule and Timeline of scripting and execution
- Deliverables of Automation Testing

*Test Execution*

Automation Scripts are executed during this phase. The scripts need input test data before there are set to run. Once executed they provide detailed test reports.

Execution can be performed using the automation tool directly or through the Test Management tool which will invoke the automation tool.

Example: Quality center is the Test Management tool which in turn it will invoke QTP for execution of automation scripts.
Scripts can be executed in a single machine or a group of machines. The execution can be done during the night, to save time.

*Framework for Automation*
A framework is set of automation guidelines which help in

-Maintaining consistency of Testing
-Improves test structuring
-Minimum usage of code
-Less Maintenance of code
-Improve re-usability
-Non Technical testers can be involved in code
-The training period of using the tool can be reduced
-Involves Data wherever appropriate

*Benefits of Automation Testing*

-70% faster than the manual testing
-Wider test coverage of application features
-Reliable in results
-Ensure Consistency
-Saves Time and Cost
-Improves accuracy
-Human Intervention is not required while execution
-Increases Efficiency
-Better speed in executing tests
-Re-usable test scripts
-Test Frequently and thoroughly
-More cycle of execution can be achieved through automation
-Early time to market

*How to Choose an Automation Tool?*
Selecting the right tool can be a tricky task. Following criterion will help you select the best tool for your requirement-

-Environment Support
-Ease of use
-Testing of Database
-Object identification
-Image Testing
-Error Recovery Testing
-Object Mapping
-Scripting Language Used
-Support for various types of test - including functional, test management, mobile, etc...
-Support for multiple testing frameworks
-Easy to debug the automation software scripts
-Ability to recognize objects in any environment
-Extensive test reports and results
-Minimize training cost of selected tools

Tool selection is one of biggest challenges to be tackled before going for automation.
First, Identify the requirements, explore various tools and its capabilities, set the expectation from the tool and go for a Proof Of Concept.

*Automation Testing Tools*
There are tons of Functional and Regression Testing Tools available in the market. Here are some best:
