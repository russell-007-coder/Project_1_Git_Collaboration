# Repository

A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

You can own repositories individually, or you can share ownership of repositories with other people in an organization.

You can restrict who has access to a repository by choosing the repository's visibility.

For user-owned repositories, you can give other people collaborator access so that they can collaborate on your project. If a repository is owned by an organization, you can give organization members access permissions to collaborate on your repository.

7. If you're not using a template, there are a number of optional items you can pre-populate your repository with. If you're importing an existing repository to GitHub, don't        choose any of these options, as you may introduce a merge conflict. You can add or create new files using the user interface or choose to add new files using the command line      later.
   You can create a README, which is a document describing your project. For more information, see "About READMEs."
   You can create a .gitignore file, which is a set of ignore rules. For more information, see "Ignoring files."
   You can choose to add a software license for your project. For more information, see "Licensing a repository."
8. Click Create repository.
